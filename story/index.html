                        <h2>A Voyage of Refugees</h2>
                        <p>
                            Paul Figot, my grandfather, escaped from Europe with his family
                            in 1941. This is their story.
                        </p>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        The voyage started from Paris to Mexico in June 1941, a year after
                        the Nazi occupation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During that whole year, life was almost normal. The Nazis did not
                        seem to cause any disturbance with their presence, although they
                        were very noticeably dressed in their military uniforms, it did
                        not affect the daily existence. Nobody knew that behind that
                        seemingly calm atmosphere during that year, the plans for the "The
                        Final Solution" were being created, carefully organized (with
                        typical Germanic efficiency) and beginning to be implemented the
                        summer of 1941.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My father was among the first five thousand Jewish men to receive
                        a notice to appear at the Police Headquarters and bring along ten
                        kilos of clothing with him. Fortunately, we lived in the wholesale
                        garment business quarters of Paris, mostly inhabited by Jews,
                        therefore the news spread like wildfire that whoever went to the
                        Police Station did not return home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My parents heeded the warning and had the presence of mind to
                        concoct a plan so that my father wouldn't have to appear at the
                        Police Station. My father had always had stomach problems, and so
                        my parents had many X-rays in their possession. This accumulation
                        of X-rays of my father&rsquo;s stomach inspired the brilliant idea that
                        would go on to save his life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My mother contacted our family doctor—a fellow Jew—and, after
                        explaining the situation, she asked for a medical certificate
                        stating that my father was ill in bed. The doctor did not hesitate
                        to write the certificate, backdated to the week prior. My mother
                        arrived at the Police Station with fear in her heart and hope in
                        her mind that the Doctor&rsquo;s certificate and the X-rays would be
                        sufficient to convince the Nazis that my father was unwell. She
                        explained to the authorities why she had come instead of my father
                        while handing over the medical certificate and the X-rays. They
                        read the certificate but, given their lack of medical training,
                        did not inspect the X-rays. They returned the documents to my
                        mother, warning her that as soon as my father was well enough, he
                        had to report to the Police Station immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do not know how my father found the right contacts and how he
                        did so with such speed, but the fact is that he arranged
                        passports, transportation to the small town of Pau (near the
                        Spanish border), passage on a ship leaving from Bilbao to Cuba,
                        and a transit visa to Cuba itself. I have a vague recollection of
                        my mother packing and my father running into the bedroom and
                        jumping into bed every time the doorbell rang.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It did not take us long to be ready. My mother packed all that was
                        new—towels, bedding, tablecloths and whatever else she could
                        store—in suitcases and in a blue trunk with three wooden
                        reinforcement bands around it. I do not remember how much luggage
                        we took with us, but it must have been quite a few. We had to be
                        very cautious and discreet so as not to arouse suspicions because
                        the caretaker of the building was a nosy, mean, bitter spinster
                        who was most anti-Semitic. As it was summer and children were
                        already on vacation, it was easy to tell her that we were leaving
                        to the country for a few weeks—in those days it was customary to
                        rent a house in the country for the summer vacations, so therefore
                        it all seemed natural and did not arouse suspicions. We left and
                        never came back to the apartment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My mother left the keys of the apartment with my uncle Adolphe and
                        told him to take as much as he could of the apartment&rsquo;s contents;
                        there was plenty to be taken including food that my mother had
                        stockpiled in case of scarcity, such as a substantial amount of
                        flour, eggs, sugar, salt, pasta, etc…; but, as we found out after
                        the war, the caretaker did not allow him into the apartment and
                        all was lost. In retrospect, I think that perhaps the caretaker
                        may have had suspicions about our escape but let us leave without
                        reporting us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Faint memories remain in my mind of the journey to Pau, disjointed
                        images of traveling in a car, being cautioned by my parents to go
                        quietly through fields, and finally reaching the town of Pau,
                        where we stayed three months. An important recollection is that my
                        brother bought a book to study English by himself; thinking back,
                        I wonder why he did not choose Spanish, since our destination was
                        a Spanish-speaking country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yom Kippur fell on the day we had to leave Pau, and because my
                        mother was a strong believer, having grown up in a very religious
                        home, she firmly refused to travel on that day, unaware of the
                        complications her decision would cause. We left the next day, and
                        perhaps because Spain in 1941 was still in chaos from the civil
                        war, the trains did not keep a proper schedule and delays were a
                        common occurrence. We had passed the border through the Pyrenees,
                        stopping in Zaragoza to take the connecting train to Bilbao. We
                        waited a long time, sitting on suitcases in the middle of a
                        crowded train platform until the train finally appeared.
                        Therefore, we arrived in Bilbao the day after the ship&rsquo;s
                        departure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When my parents realized that the ship had left, I suppose they
                        must have been very upset and worried. I do not know how long we
                        remained in Bilbao, yet I remember, but do not know the reason
                        why, that my mother traveled to Barcelona by train on her own.
                        Later we—my father, brother and I—joined her there. (It is beyond
                        my comprehension how my mother had the courage to cross from
                        Bilbao all the way to Barcelona on her own, in a foreign country
                        and without speaking the language.) By the time we arrived in
                        Barcelona, my mother had the tickets ready for us to embark on a
                        cargo ship named Tenerife. While we waited for the day of
                        departure—not long—we stayed in a small and very elegant hotel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first port of call was the Rock of Gibraltar, next was the
                        island of Tenerife, and then we docked in Lisbon long enough to
                        make a short visit into the city and taste white bread, which we
                        hadn't had for a very long time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For my mother, the crossing of the Atlantic to Cuba was a
                        nightmare from beginning to end. The ship, a cargo vessel, had
                        been adapted for passengers, meaning that the hull where
                        merchandise would have been stored was filled with layers and
                        layers of bunks piled up one on top of the other. The whole area
                        was used as men&rsquo;s sleeping quarters. Women with small children
                        slept in the front and back of the ship. It was a small ship and
                        very crowded, yet for us children, it was lots of fun. But for my
                        mother, the ship&rsquo;s movement back and forth was sheer agony, and
                        the journey seemed to last an eternity; the seasickness took hold
                        from the start and lasted the whole trip. She was so ill that she
                        did not believe she would reach Cuba alive; but fortunately, she
                        did.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ship carried Jewish refugees only, with most from Germany.
                        During the journey, my brother—true to his character—steadfastly
                        studied English, and by the time we reached Cuba, he had finished
                        the book. After one full month at sea, we finally arrived to Cuba,
                        but we did not disembark in Havana. We were taken to a small
                        island called Triscornia, where we were quarantined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we were released and entered Havana, we lived in The Malecón
                        (the waterfront) at first. But due to the uncertainty of the
                        future and the need to rely only on what we had brought with us
                        from France for a living, we had to be cautious, so we moved to
                        the center of the city in search of a more economical rent. The
                        street where we lived was called La Merced. We stayed in Havana
                        eleven months and during that time, my mother found by chance
                        relatives of hers, my brother celebrated his Bar-Mitzvah, we went
                        to a Jewish school, and we learned Spanish very quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because all we had was a transit visa to Cuba, it was imperative
                        to find another country where would be able to establish ourselves
                        permanently. My mother wrote three letters explaining our
                        circumstances: one to her brother living in Buenos Aires,
                        Argentina; one to my father&rsquo;s uncle in Brooklyn, NY; and one to my
                        mother&rsquo;s first cousin in Mexico City, Mexico. I do not know how
                        she got hold of the addresses, but she received answers some time
                        later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first came from her cousin Adek Gorney, saying that he had
                        already started the procedure for us to enter Mexico, and that as
                        soon as the documentation for a permanent permit to reside in the
                        country as war refugees was ready, he would send it to us. A week
                        later we received the reply from my father&rsquo;s uncle saying that he
                        would sign an affidavit as guarantor for us to enter the United
                        States.
                    </p>
                    <p>Evidently, fate chose Mexico.</p>
