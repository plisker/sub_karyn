              <h2>A Voyage of Refugees</h2>
              <p>
                Paul Figot, my grandfather, escaped from Europe with his family
                in 1941. This is their story.
              </p>
            </header>
            <p>
              The voyage started from Paris to Mexico in June 1941, a year after
              the Nazi occupation.
            </p>
            <p>
              During that whole year, life was almost normal. The Nazis did not
              seem to cause any disturbance with their presence, although they
              were very noticeably dressed in their military uniforms, it did
              not affect the daily existence. Nobody knew that behind that
              seemingly calm atmosphere during that year, the plans for the "The
              Final Solution" were being created, carefully organized (with
              typical Germanic efficiency) and beginning to be implemented the
              summer of 1941.
            </p>
            <p>
              My father was among the first five thousand Jewish men to receive
              a notice to appear at the Police Headquarters and bring along ten
              kilos of clothing with him. Fortunately, we lived in the wholesale
              garment business quarters of Paris, mostly inhabited by Jews,
              therefore the news spread like wildfire that whoever went to the
              Police Station did not return home.
            </p>
            <p>
              My parents heeded the warning and had the presence of mind to
              concoct a plan so that my father wouldn't have to appear at the
              Police Station. My father had always had stomach problems, and so
              my parents had many X-rays in their possession. This accumulation
              of X-rays of my father's stomach inspired the brilliant idea that
              would go on to save his life.
            </p>
            <p>
              My mother contacted our family doctor—a fellow Jew—and, after
              explaining the situation, she asked for a medical certificate
              stating that my father was ill in bed. The doctor did not hesitate
              to write the certificate, backdated to the week prior. My mother
              arrived at the Police Station with fear in her heart and hope in
              her mind that the Doctor's certificate and the X-rays would be
              sufficient to convince the Nazis that my father was unwell. She
              explained to the authorities why she had come instead of my father
              while handing over the medical certificate and the X-rays. They
              read the certificate but, given their lack of medical training,
              did not inspect the X-rays. They returned the documents to my
              mother, warning her that as soon as my father was well enough, he
              had to report to the Police Station immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              I do not know how my father found the right contacts and how he
              did so with such speed, but the fact is that he arranged
              passports, transportation to the small town of Pau (near the
              Spanish border), passage on a ship leaving from Bilbao to Cuba,
              and a transit visa to Cuba itself. I have a vague recollection of
              my mother packing and my father running into the bedroom and
              jumping into bed every time the doorbell rang.
            </p>
            <p>
              It did not take us long to be ready. My mother packed all that was
              new—towels, bedding, tablecloths and whatever else she could
              store—in suitcases and in a blue trunk with three wooden
              reinforcement bands around it. I do not remember how much luggage
              we took with us, but it must have been quite a few. We had to be
              very cautious and discreet so as not to arouse suspicions because
              the caretaker of the building was a nosy, mean, bitter spinster
              who was most anti-Semitic. As it was summer and children were
              already on vacation, it was easy to tell her that we were leaving
              to the country for a few weeks—in those days it was customary to
              rent a house in the country for the summer vacations, so therefore
              it all seemed natural and did not arouse suspicions. We left and
              never came back to the apartment.
            </p>
            <p>
              My mother left the keys of the apartment with my uncle Adolphe and
              told him to take as much as he could of the apartment’s contents;
              there was plenty to be taken including food that my mother had
              stockpiled in case of scarcity, such as a substantial amount of
              flour, eggs, sugar, salt, pasta, etc…; but, as we found out after
              the war, the caretaker did not allow him into the apartment and
              all was lost. In retrospect, I think that perhaps the caretaker
              may have had suspicions about our escape but let us leave without
              reporting us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Faint memories remain in my mind of the journey to Pau, disjointed
              images of traveling in a car, being cautioned by my parents to go
              quietly through fields, and finally reaching the town of Pau,
              where we stayed three months. An important recollection is that my
              brother bought a book to study English by himself; thinking back,
              I wonder why he did not choose Spanish, since our destination was
              a Spanish-speaking country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yom Kippur fell on the day we had to leave Pau, and because my
              mother was a strong believer, having grown up in a very religious
              home, she firmly refused to travel on that day, unaware of the
              complications her decision would cause. We left the next day, and
              perhaps because Spain in 1941 was still in chaos from the civil
              war, the trains did not keep a proper schedule and delays were a
              common occurrence. We had passed the border through the Pyrenees,
              stopping in Zaragoza to take the connecting train to Bilbao. We
              waited a long time, sitting on suitcases in the middle of a
              crowded train platform until the train finally appeared.
              Therefore, we arrived in Bilbao the day after the ship's
              departure.
            </p>
            <p>
              When my parents realized that the ship had left, I suppose they
              must have been very upset and worried. I do not know how long we
              remained in Bilbao, yet I remember, but do not know the reason
              why, that my mother traveled to Barcelona by train on her own.
              Later we—my father, brother and I—joined her there. (It is beyond
              my comprehension how my mother had the courage to cross from
              Bilbao all the way to Barcelona on her own, in a foreign country
              and without speaking the language.) By the time we arrived in
              Barcelona, my mother had the tickets ready for us to embark on a
              cargo ship named Tenerife. While we waited for the day of
              departure—not long—we stayed in a small and very elegant hotel.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first port of call was the Rock of Gibraltar, next was the
              island of Tenerife, and then we docked in Lisbon long enough to
              make a short visit into the city and taste white bread, which we
              hadn't had for a very long time.
            </p>
            <p>
              For my mother, the crossing of the Atlantic to Cuba was a
              nightmare from beginning to end. The ship, a cargo vessel, had
              been adapted for passengers, meaning that the hull where
              merchandise would have been stored was filled with layers and
              layers of bunks piled up one on top of the other. The whole area
              was used as men’s sleeping quarters. Women with small children
              slept in the front and back of the ship. It was a small ship and
              very crowded, yet for us children, it was lots of fun. But for my
              mother, the ship’s movement back and forth was sheer agony, and
              the journey seemed to last an eternity; the seasickness took hold
              from the start and lasted the whole trip. She was so ill that she
              did not believe she would reach Cuba alive; but fortunately, she
              did.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ship carried Jewish refugees only, with most from Germany.
              During the journey, my brother—true to his character—steadfastly
              studied English, and by the time we reached Cuba, he had finished
              the book. After one full month at sea, we finally arrived to Cuba,
              but we did not disembark in Havana. We were taken to a small
              island called Triscornia, where we were quarantined.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we were released and entered Havana, we lived in The Malecón
              (the waterfront) at first. But due to the uncertainty of the
              future and the need to rely only on what we had brought with us
              from France for a living, we had to be cautious, so we moved to
              the center of the city in search of a more economical rent. The
              street where we lived was called La Merced. We stayed in Havana
              eleven months and during that time, my mother found by chance
              relatives of hers, my brother celebrated his Bar-Mitzvah, we went
              to a Jewish school, and we learned Spanish very quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because all we had was a transit visa to Cuba, it was imperative
              to find another country where would be able to establish ourselves
              permanently. My mother wrote three letters explaining our
              circumstances: one to her brother living in Buenos Aires,
              Argentina; one to my father's uncle in Brooklyn, NY; and one to my
              mother's first cousin in Mexico City, Mexico. I do not know how
              she got hold of the addresses, but she received answers some time
              later.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first came from her cousin Adek Gorney, saying that he had
              already started the procedure for us to enter Mexico, and that as
              soon as the documentation for a permanent permit to reside in the
              country as war refugees was ready, he would send it to us. A week
              later we received the reply from my father's uncle saying that he
              would sign an affidavit as guarantor for us to enter the United
              States.
            </p>
            <p>Evidently, fate chose Mexico.</p>
